# myCLEARopinion Panel Expands Presence in Food Safety

myCLEARopinion’s parent company, BNP Media, has acquiredFood Safety Magazine, the go-to information source for food safety professionals.  Thisacquisitiongives Clear Seas Research’s proprietary panel, myCLEARopinion Panel, access to additional professionals in food safety professions, including plant operations, sanitation professionals, and lab directors.  This also broadens our current reach into food and beverage processing and food ingredient manufacturing and supply.Food Safety Magazine’s influential readership offers a targeted audience of food safety and quality professionals at food and beverage manufacturing companies, foodservice/retail operations, regulators, and agri-food laboratories worldwide. These decision makers implement science-based food safety strategies and systems to prevent, control, and test for chemical, microbiological, and physical hazards to ensure they do not enter the food supply—all while maintaining the quality attributes of food products expected by consumers.This acquisition adds to our panel’s ability to reach this lucrative niche market for market research professionals that need access to data and insights from survey-based feedback.  Our process of recruiting people from this and other critical industries ensures that the data we capture for customers is accurate, thorough and representative of the sectors as a whole.This acquisition will also help myCLEARopinion expand into more technical professions such as microbiology, biotechnology, and food chemists.  Our panel continues to give excellent access into niche B2B verticals thereby getting our customers more accurate insights into the decision making and thought processes of these growing and important verticals.We are excited to expand our panel’s offerings once again and look forward to offering more B2B market research access to our clients in the future.
